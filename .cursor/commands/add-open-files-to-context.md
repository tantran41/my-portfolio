# Add Open Files to Context

Read all currently open files in the editor and add them to the conversation context. This allows me to analyze, refactor, or understand relationships between multiple files simultaneously.

## Instructions

Please read all files that are currently open in the user's editor tabs and include their contents in the conversation context. This will help me:
- Understand the full context of what the user is working on
- See relationships between different files
- Provide more accurate assistance across multiple files
- Identify patterns or inconsistencies

After reading the open files, acknowledge which files were added to context and ask how you can help with them.
